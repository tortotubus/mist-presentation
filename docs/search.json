    "text": "Procedure\n\nOwing to the fact that this model is a combination of both linear and highly non-linear physical effects, we choose to fit the data set with a Generalized Additive Model, implemented by Hastie (2023).\nOur particular model is\n\n\\[\\text{temp_avg} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{elevation}) + \\beta_2 (\\text{latitude}) + \\beta_3 (\\text{longitude}) + \\beta_4f(\\text{days}).\\] since we hypothesize the partial derivatives of temp_avg with respect to longitude, latitude and elevation to be roughly constant."
